Hello there!

I see that your project website is not served over [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)! [SSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) certificates are not expensive and complex to setup anymore. Even if you do not host the site yourself, many hosts provide free tools and documentation on how to do this.

Please seriously consider adding HTTPS to your site today! Here are some resources and tools to help you get started.
