# About SSL All The Things

This account and repo was created to make a one stop shop for information on deploying and configuring SSL on webservers. Many of my favorite projects on GitHub are lacking SSL support or the website is not served over HTTPS. When a project is found to not use SSL I will send a notification or do a pull request with the change.

Whether you are sending private data or something as simple as an update check over the internet it should all be encrypted. SSL certificates are not expensive and complex to setup anymore. Even if you do not host the site yourself, many hosts provide free tools and documentation on how to do this. There will be many links and snippets of information here to make it even easier!

P.S. Yes I know SSL is deprecated since 2015 and everything should be TLS, but everyone still calls it SSL ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
